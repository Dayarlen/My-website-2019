				<td><p>In this project I had to recreate the Spectrum V by the artist Ellsworth Kelly.To recreate this project I had to figure out how to use the table to recreate Kelly's design. I had to use the ID function in order to get it working correctly, change the background color, as well as the width annd height. </p></td>
				<td>In this project we had to be able to create a chose your own adventure game. I used python in order to create this game. The commands I used the most were the else, elif and if commands to create the choices for the player. I used the input command in order to give the user the ability to type their choice.</td>
